## Learning objectives

- [ ] check the **status** of the working tree and the staging area

Let's recall the git commit workflow:

1. We make **changes** to our source code **in the working tree**.
2. We then **stage** our changes.
3. We then **commit** our **staged changes**.

The **working tree** is a key concept in Git.
It is the directory with the files and folders that we can view and edit.
When we're making changes to our code in VSCode, we're making changes in the working tree.

To understand what is happening in this workshop, you will need to continually check the **status** of the **Working Tree** and the **Staging Area**.

So let's start with a check...

## ðŸ‘£ Steps

1. Run the command `git status --help` and check the name and description of this command (Press `q` to quit)
2. Open the repo you cloned down during setup, and run the command `git status`
3. Discuss the log you get from running the command `git status` - what do you think this tells you at the moment?

## Learning objectives

```objectives
- [ ] Formulate acceptance criteria from a problem statement
- [ ] Create assertions to check different test cases
- [ ] Implement functionality using assertions
- [ ] Interpret documentation on JavaScript logical operators
```

## ðŸ§° Setup


In this workshop, you'll need to:
1. Split up into groups of 4

## Context

To begin, you'll need some context.

Use this page ðŸ‘‰ https://www.mathsisfun.com/triangle.html to get the names of different triangles depending on their three side lengths.
_There should be 3 different names. Check with each other that you all understand what these names mean._


## Problem statement

In this workshop, you'll need to implement a function that takes **the three side lengths of a triangle** and returns a string indicating whether it is **`"equilateral"`**, **`"isoceles"`** or **`"scalene"`**

## Acceptance criteria

 
First, name the function according to the problem statement. The name should be semantic. It should convey what the function does.
Then set out acceptance criteria for your function in the format shown below:

_Given_ ...
_When_ ...
_Then_ ...

## ðŸ§ª Write your first assertion

Write your first assertion using `console.assert` to check the functionality. You can write your code in `triangles.js`

## ðŸ§± Start building up your functionality

Once you've got your first assertion down, you'll need to start building out your functionality for this case.
